;; Lingo's pieces comprise Clojure data structures. Maps are the
;; primary structure used to express each part of speech we're
;; interested in.

;; For example, an empty clause looks like this:

{:> :clause}

;; The key :> is the identifier key. It tells us what kind of part we
;; plan on generating. Here are other parts we're able to generate:

{:> :noun}
{:> :verb}
{:> :subject}
{:> :object}

;; Generating any of these parts will create empty phrases. To do
;; something more useful, we're able to "add" specific pieces to our
;; parts.

;; A noun can simply pass a string or a vector of two strings, the
;; first being what's known as the determiner ("the", "a", or "that")
;; and the second being the actual phrase.

{:> :noun :+ "dog"}

{:> :noun :+ ["the" "dog"]}

;; However verbs accept only one string.

{:> :verb :+ "run"}

;; Subjects and objects are only nouns, but they're used to
;; specifically create clauses. Clauses take a vector of one of each
;; a subject, object and verb as well as many complements as you wish.
;; We'll cover complements soon.

(def dog-and-rabbit
  {:> :clause
   :+ [{:> :subject :+ ["the" "dog"]}
       {:> :verb    :+ "chase"}
       {:> :object  :+ ["the" "rabbit"]}]})

;; In order to generate our pieces into speech, we need to create
;; a generator.

(def generator (make-gen))

;; The generator contains two primary functions, accessed as keys to
;; a Clojure map.

;; The first creates SimpleNLG objects. Once created, you can use
;; Java methods to access fields and (not recommended!) mutate them.

(:* generator)

;; The second realises- or "renders"- our speech into a sentence.
;; It's recommended to do as many operations on Clojure data
;; structures before passing them to the generator.

(:! generator)

;; We pass the realisation function to our dog and rabbit clause to
;; see the generated result.

((:! generator) dog-and-rabbit)
;; => "The dog chases the rabbit."

;; We can manipulate our clauses just as maps, and we can even make
;; philosphical inqueries.

((:! generator)
 (assoc dog-and-rabbit :* {:feature [:why :?]}))
;; => "Why does the dog chase the rabbit?"

;; By assoc-ing the :* key with a feature, we were able to turn our
;; statement into a question. The :* key is known as the modifier key.

;; Modifiers can be a great deal of different things. Here are several
;; examples of what you can pass as the :* key

{:> :verb :+ "run" :* "quickly"} ;; Adds an adverb

{:> :noun :+ "dog" :* "confused"} ;; Adds an adjective

((:! generator)
 {:> :noun
  :+ "management"
  :* [:pre "time"]}) ;; A pre-modifier resides before the phrase.

((:! generator)
 {:> :noun
  :+ "management"
  :* [:post "time"]}) ;; A post-modifier resides after the phrase.

;; Complements are similar to modifiers, but they can represent
;; general phrases.

(def park-chase
  (assoc dog-and-rabbit :* {:complement "around the park"}))

((:! generator) park-chase)
;; => "The dog chases the rabbit around the park."

;; We can also add as many features and complements, in any order,
;; as we like.

((:! generator)
 (merge
   dog-and-rabbit
   {:* [{:feature [:how :?]}
        {:feature [:is :perfect]}
        {:feature [:future :tense]}
        {:complement "around the park"}]}))
;; => "How will the dog have chased the rabbit around the park?"

;; Modifiers can even be other parts to create coordinated phrases.

((:! generator)
 {:> :noun :+ "Jack"
  :* [{:> :noun :+ "Wendy"}
      {:> :noun :+ "Danny"}]})
;; => "Jack, Wendy and Danny."

;; We can combine all of these pieces to create well known phrases.

(def redrum
  {:> :clause
   :+ [{:> :subject
        :+ "work"
        :* [{:> :noun :+ "play" :* [:pre "no"]}
            [:pre "all"]]}
       {:> :verb :+ "make"}
       {:> :object :+ "Jack"}
       {:> :complement :+ "a dull boy"}]
   :* {:feature [:base-infinitive :form]}})

((:! generator) redrum)
;; => "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
